SUPPORT:
--------   
Since KHRONOS is distributed for free, support is not offered. KHRONOS is coded according 
to current web standards and we did our best to make the template easy to use and modify.
If you have minimum web development experience, you can easily modify the template. 
However, If you're still new to HTML and CSS, I suggest that you visit the 
following tutorials:

 - https://marksheet.io/
 - http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/

These will teach you the essentials of HTML and CSS. In addition, if you want to include
javascript in your skill-set, you can also check out these tutorials: 

 - https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript
 - https://javascript.info/

USING THE MAILCHIMP FORM:
-------------------------
To use the mailchimp form you need a mailchimp url. To get the mailchimp url, login to 
your mailchimp account, click the Audience menu and select signup forms. Then choose 
embedded forms and select unstyled form. In the generated form code get the value of 
the form ACTION attribute and use it as your mailchimp url. Open the main.js file located
in the template's "js" folder and look for this line of code: 

const cfg = {

    // Countdown Timer Final Date
    finalDate : 'March 20, 2024 00:00:00',
    // MailChimp URL
    mailChimpURL : 'https://facebook.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=1abf75f6981256963a47d197a&amp;id=37c6d8f4d6' 

};


Replace the value of mailChimpURL with your mailchimp url.
